Ever wonder if you could model the behavior of complicated systems such as an ecosystem? This notebook is a system dynamics walks through that also teaches how to use the power of modeling to understand complext environmetal behaviors. This notebook uses systems dynamics through the use of Vensim, a systems dynamics modeling software, and pysd python package to model the relationships between saltwater marsh grasses, sediment accreation and sea level rise.
